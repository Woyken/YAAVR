# YAAVR - Yet Another Asymmetric VR game

My attempt to make assymetric vr game in Unity. At the moment there's a lot of stuff missing, couldn't even call it an alpha.

More details here: [YAAVR Board](https://trello.com/b/ZYxdKTGw/yaavr).

## Idea

Idea is to create similar game to Mass Exodus, Panoptic.

Where VR player is playing against couch players.

## Tasks

All planned and ongoing tasks are tracked here: [YAAVR Board](https://trello.com/b/ZYxdKTGw/yaavr).

If by any chance you have stumbled upon this project and have any ideas, feel free to leave a comment on the board.

## Preview at the moment

Who doesn't love playing with ragdolls?
